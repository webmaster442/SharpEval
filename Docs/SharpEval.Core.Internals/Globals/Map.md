# Globals.Map method (1 of 2)

Re-maps a number from one range to another. That is, a value of fromLow would get mapped to toLow, a value of fromHigh to toHigh, values in-between to values in-between, etc.

```csharp
public static double Map(double value, double fromLow, double fromHigh, double toLow, double toHigh)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| value | the number to map. |
| fromLow | the lower bound of the value’s current range. |
| fromHigh | the upper bound of the value’s current range. |
| toLow | the lower bound of the value’s target range. |
| toHigh | the upper bound of the value’s target range. |

## Return Value

The mapped double value.

# Globals.Map method (2 of 2)

Re-maps a number from one range to another. That is, a value of fromLow would get mapped to toLow, a value of fromHigh to toHigh, values in-between to values in-between, etc.

```csharp
public static long Map(long value, long fromLow, long fromHigh, long toLow, long toHigh)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| value | the number to map. |
| fromLow | the lower bound of the value’s current range. |
| fromHigh | the upper bound of the value’s current range. |
| toLow | the lower bound of the value’s target range. |
| toHigh | the upper bound of the value’s target range. |

## Return Value

The mapped long value.
